# 🌐 CSS & SCSS Practice — 30 Week Challenge

This repository contains all my **frontend assignments (1–12)** where I practiced and built small projects using **HTML, CSS, and SCSS**.  
Each assignment focuses on improving layout, design, and responsiveness using modern web techniques.  

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- CSS fundamentals — margin, padding, background, positioning  
- **Flexbox** and **Grid** for layout  
- **Bento Grid** and creative section design  
- **SCSS** — mixins, nesting, partials, imports  
- **Transitions, transforms, and hover effects**  
- **Responsive design** using `clamp()`, relative units & media queries
