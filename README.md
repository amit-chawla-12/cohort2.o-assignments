# Cohort 2.0 Assignments

This repository contains my web development assignments from Cohort 2.0.  
Each assignment is live and hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

⚠️ Note: These assignments are not fully responsive yet.  
I will update them with **responsive design (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)** once I learn responsiveness.

- [Assignment 1](https://amit-chawla-12.github.io/cohort2.o-assignments/assingment%201/)  
  Created a **very simple personal portfolio** using basic HTML tags (`h`, `p`), colors, margins, and padding.

- [Assignment 2](https://amit-chawla-12.github.io/cohort2.o-assignments/assingment%202/)  
  Practiced **CSS background images**, downloaded and used external fonts/images, created a **button in HTML** and styled it with CSS.

- [Assignment 3](https://amit-chawla-12.github.io/cohort2.o-assignments/assingment%203/)  
  Combined previous concepts with **CSS positioning** — created overlapping images and layouts using `absolute`, `relative`, etc.

- [Assignment 4](https://amit-chawla-12.github.io/cohort2.o-assignments/assingment%204/)  
  Cloned **half of Apple’s website** using **Flexbox**, hover effects, and all previously learned CSS properties.
